# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called
# first_name # and last_name, and then create several other attributes
# that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called
# describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make
# another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized
# greeting to the user.
#
# Create several instances representing different users, and call both
# methods for each user.
