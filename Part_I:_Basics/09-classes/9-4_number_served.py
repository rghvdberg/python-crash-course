# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1
# (page 162). Add an attribute called number_served with a default
# value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant from this class.
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then
# change this value and print it again.
#
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the
# number of customers that have been served. Call this method with
# a new number and print the value again.
#
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with
# any number you like that could represent how many customers were served
# in, say, a day of business.
