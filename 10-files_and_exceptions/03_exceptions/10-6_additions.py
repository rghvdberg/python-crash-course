# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
# occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
# the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for
# two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if
# either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
# program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
# number.
